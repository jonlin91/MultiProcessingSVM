# MultiProcessingSVM

Using SVM to identify subjective sports articles from objective ones. The focus of this work was to speed up the hyperparameter optimisation in case we were to work on larger datasets. We compare multi-processing that we wrote from scratch with the inbuilt sklearn GridSearchCV function. Our multi-processing method works faster.
